# StoryToolkitAI

## Description

**StoryToolkitAI is a film editing tool that tries to understand your footage and helps you edit more efficiently with the assistance of AI.**

It transcribes, indexes scenes, helps you search through your footage, automatically selects and creates stories using large language models (OpenAI GPT-4, llama, DeepSeek etc.),
which you can then import into your editing software via EDL or XML.

The tool works locally on your machine, independent of any other editing software, but it also integrates with DaVinci Resolve Studio 18+.
